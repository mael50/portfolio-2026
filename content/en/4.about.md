Full Stack Developer & Project Manager

#intro
I am a **Full Stack Developer** based in **Normandy**, France, dedicated to building high-performance, tailored web solutions.

Graduating in 2026 with an **MBA in Web Digital Project Management** from **MyDigitalSchool Caen**, I have built a strong foundation through diverse experiences in **web agencies** and corporate environments.

My technical expertise focuses on **Nuxt**, **Symfony**, and **WordPress**. My superpower? I handle projects from **A to Z**: from development to deployment and ongoing maintenance.

Currently **Open to Work**, I am available for new technical challenges across France and beyond.

When I'm not coding, I'm a huge **motorsports** fan and constantly keeping up with the latest **High Tech** trends.
